        <p>I wanted to learn poker but I didn't have the patience or skill level to read the dense "teach yourself" books that are out there. When I found Color Up's Texas Hold’em 101 deck, I was pleasantly surprised!  They really break it down so that even a beginner like me can learn the ins and outs of the game. It even comes with a hand-rank cheat sheet I can use at the poker table.</p>

        <p>I've been playing poker for the last 10 years, so as you can imagine I didn’t think these cards would really help me. My friend lent me his pot odds deck and it has completely changed the way I look at the game. I realized quickly that I had no idea how hand odds and pot odds worked. Thanks to these cards my game has improved so much that I’m winning noticeable more hands.</p>
